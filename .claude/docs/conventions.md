# Agent Conventions

## Bibliographic integrity
- Never invent references or metadata.
- Omit unknown fields instead of guessing.
- Keep UTF-8 encoding.

## Annotation quality
Every BibTeX entry should include a substantive `note`:
- core argument
- relevance to research question
- position/tension in debate

## File contracts

- domain researcher: `intermediate_files/literature-domain-N.bib`
- synthesis planner: `intermediate_files/synthesis-outline.md`
